  <h2>My Three Biggest Projects!</h2>
</header>
<div>
<h3> Spotify's Web Player:</h3>
<p> I was able to work abit with spotify on their website and helped them on their Indie playlist they have on their main screen. All I do is update the songs monthly and add new songs and replacing the old ones. This was my first Big project and I am greatful that I was able to work for such a big company.</p>

<h4> Apple's Music Web Player:</h4>
<p> For my second big project I was able to kinda do the same from my last project but this time they let me control more playlist. They let me organized and design their Browse Our Pick's section and i was able to make all those playlist on their website for that section.</p>

<h5> Youtube Music:</h5>
<p>My last big project I was able to have the opportunity and work with youtube. Since they knew that I have already worked with two of the biggest music apps/website they assiagned me to help work on their home page and it was a honnor to do so. They allowed me to set up the bluprint og how the website was going to be designed and organized. And to me that was one of my biggest projects ever and I was proud that I was able to work with them on this because it lead me to get even more jobs with other companys and helped me push my name out their to other clients. </p>
